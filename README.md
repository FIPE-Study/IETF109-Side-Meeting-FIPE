### **Goal**
The goal of this side meeting is to make progress on defining research challenges and problems related to the future evolution of the Internet Protocol suite  that are not already better covered by other IRTF RG. 

There is a myriad of booming heterogeneous networking technologies, such as space-terrestrial networks, Internet of Things (IoT) networks, industrial networks, etc. We also see a continuous increase of application areas into which Internet technologies and solutions penetrate, such as industrial communication, automation, transportation and others. This poses new challenges, such as the proliferation of various addressing modes (used for specific access technologies), the integration of vast number of low power sensors, fast changing topologies (possibly with moving network elements), different terminal mobility, and need for interconnections across those networking technologies. 

This side meeting will specifically focus on potential multiple addressing schemas, particularly those of varying semantics. We will concentrate on whether increasingly diversified services, particularly that may not be limited to destination-based provisioning, may require new schemas rather than the current topology-based IP addressing. We will discuss the possibilities and technical challenges for geographical addressing, service-oriented addressing, and others. As one example, we will look into the need for supporting the rapidly changing topology in satellite networks through a suitable new addressing schema.

Considering that various semantic addressing & routing schemas may co-exist in a single physical network, the domain boundary division related to different semantics is a critical research object. For example, self-driving vehicles use a semantic schema that provide dynamic services for high speed mobility, while low-power sensors that share the same physical network request lightweight address schema in order to have high payload efficiency. If several schemas are available, their domain boundaries or schema choosing policies should be carefully and clearly specified. Any failure may result in serious issues such as routing loops, low efficiency, security gaps, etc.

Orientation of multi-semantic addressing does bring new requirements and impacts to the control and forwarding plane. New semantic addressing information needs to be advertised, and routing protocols may have to be modified or updated to meet the new action models. The new forwarding behaviors that match new semantic addressing architecture are one of the research objectives.

We welcome any proposals and discussions to that end.
